Rebel Tracker
===

### How it Works
This uses [Parliament's API](http://www.data.parliament.uk/) to work out which MPs have most often defied their party's whip this parliament (58th). The code generates html files containing tables which detail the most Rebellious MPs for each of the major parties (Conservatives, Labour, SNP) as well as the most rebellious MPs overall. The html files are designed to easily be incorporated into websites without back-end integration. They can be added through Iframes or through JavaScript.
